<h1>Lab 1: Booting a PC</h1>
<p>
<b>Due Thursday, September 13, 2018</b>
</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
This lab is split into three parts.
The first part concentrates on getting familiarized
with x86 assembly language,
the QEMU x86 emulator,
and the PC's power-on bootstrap procedure.
The second part examines the boot loader for our 6.828 kernel,
which resides in the <tt>boot</tt> directory of the <tt>lab</tt> tree.
Finally, the third part delves into the initial template
for our 6.828 kernel itself,
named JOS,
which resides in the <tt>kernel</tt> directory.
</p>

<h3 id="Software-Setup">Software Setup</h3>
<p>
The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments in this
course are distributed using the <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a>
version control system.
To learn more about Git, take a look at the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, or, if you are already familiar with other version control
systems, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
overview of Git</a> useful.
</p>

<p>
The URL for the course Git repository is
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/jos.git">https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/jos.git</a>.
To install the files in your Athena account, you need to <i>clone</i> the
course repository, by running the commands below.
You must use an x86 Athena machine; that is, <tt>uname -a</tt>
should mention <tt>i386 GNU/Linux</tt> or <tt>i686 GNU/Linux</tt> or
<tt>x86_64 GNU/Linux</tt>.
You can log into a public Athena host with <tt>ssh -X athena.dialup.mit.edu</tt>.
</p>

<pre>athena% <kbd>mkdir ~/6.828</kbd>
athena% <kbd>cd ~/6.828</kbd>
athena% <kbd>add git</kbd>
athena% <kbd>git clone https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/jos.git lab</kbd>
Cloning into lab...
athena% <kbd>cd lab</kbd>
athena% 
</pre>

<p>
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want
to checkpoint your progress, you can <i>commit</i> your changes
by running:
</p>
<pre>athena% <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution for lab1 exercise 9'</kbd>
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for lab1 exercise 9
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
athena% 
</pre>

<p>
You can keep track of your changes by using the <kbd>git diff</kbd> command.
Running <kbd>git diff</kbd> will display the changes to your code since your
last commit, and <kbd>git diff origin/lab1</kbd> will display the changes
relative to the initial code supplied for this lab.
Here, <tt>origin/lab1</tt> is the name of the git branch with the
initial code you downloaded from our server for this assignment.
</p>

<p>We have set up the appropriate compilers and simulators for you on
Athena.  To use them, run <kbd>add -f 6.828</kbd>.  You must run this
command every time you log in (or add it to your
<tt>~/.environment</tt> file).  If you get obscure errors while
compiling or running <tt>qemu</tt>, double check that you added the
course locker.</p>

<!-- XXX We might not actually *need* any QMEU patches any more if we
     switch to the E1000, though some of the debugging ones will still
     be highly recommended. -->
<p>If you are working on a non-Athena machine, you'll need to install
<tt>qemu</tt> and possibly <tt>gcc</tt> following the directions on
the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/tools.html">tools page</a>.  We've made several
useful debugging changes to <tt>qemu</tt> and some of the later labs
depend on these patches, so you must build your
own.  If your machine uses a native ELF toolchain (such as Linux and
most BSD's, but notably <i>not</i> OS X), you can simply install
<tt>gcc</tt> from your package manager.  Otherwise, follow the
directions on the tools page.
</p>

<h3 id="Hand-In-Procedure">Hand-In Procedure</h3>

<p>
You will turn in your assignments using the <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2018/handin.py/">submission website</a>.
You need to request an API key from the submission website before you can turn
in any assignments or labs.
</p>

<p>
The lab code comes with GNU Make rules to make submission easier. After
committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>make handin</kbd> to submit
your lab.
</p><pre>athena% <kbd>git commit -am "ready to submit my lab"</kbd>

</pre>
<kbd>make handin</kbd> will store your API key in <i>myapi.key</i>. If you need
to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
<p></p>

<p>
If use <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
</p><pre> M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
<p></p>

<p>
In the case that <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2018/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can run <kbd>make grade</kbd>
to test your solutions with the grading program. The <a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2018/handin.py/">web interface</a> uses the
same grading program to assign your lab submission a grade. You should check
the output of the grader (it may take a few minutes since the grader runs
periodically) and ensure that you received the grade which you expected. If the
grades don't match, your lab submission probably has a bug -- check the output
of the grader (resp-lab*.txt) to see which particular test failed.
</p>

<p>
For Lab 1, you do not need to turn in answers to any of the questions below.
(Do answer them for yourself though!  They will help with the rest of the lab.)
</p>

<h2 id="Part-1--PC-Bootstrap">Part 1: PC Bootstrap</h2>

The purpose of the first exercise
is to introduce you to x86 assembly language
and the PC bootstrap process,
and to get you started with QEMU and QEMU/GDB debugging.
You will not have to write any code for this part of the lab,
but you should go through it anyway for your own understanding
and be prepared to answer the questions posed below.

<h3 id="Getting-Started-with-x86-assembly">Getting Started with x86 assembly</h3>

<p>
If you are not already familiar with x86 assembly language,
you will quickly become familiar with it during this course!
The <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf">PC Assembly Language Book</a>
is an excellent place to start.
Hopefully, the book contains mixture of new and old material for you.
</p>

<p><i>Warning:</i> Unfortunately the examples in the book are
written for the NASM assembler, whereas we will be using
the GNU assembler. NASM uses the so-called <i>Intel</i> syntax
while GNU uses the <i>AT&amp;T</i> syntax. While semantically
equivalent, an assembly file will differ quite a lot, at least
superficially, depending on which syntax is used. Luckily the
conversion between the two is pretty simple, and is covered in
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html">Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly</a>.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-1" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 1.</span>
Familiarize yourself with the assembly language materials available on
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html">the 6.828 reference page</a>.  You
don't have to read them now, but you'll almost certainly want to refer
to some of this material when reading and writing x86 assembly.
</p>
<p>
We do recommend reading the section "The Syntax" in
<a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/brennan/brennan_att_inline_djgpp.html">Brennan's Guide to Inline Assembly</a>.
It gives a good (and quite brief) description of the AT&amp;T assembly
syntax we'll be using with the GNU assembler in JOS.
</p>
</div>

<p>Certainly the definitive reference for x86 assembly language programming
is Intel's instruction set architecture reference,
which you can find on
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html">the 6.828 reference page</a>
in two flavors:
an HTML edition of the old
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/i386/toc.htm">80386 Programmer's Reference Manual</a>,
which is much shorter and easier to navigate than more recent manuals
but describes all of the x86 processor features
that we will make use of in 6.828;
and the full, latest and greatest
<a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html">
IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manuals</a> from Intel,
covering all the features of the most recent processors
that we won't need in class but you may be interested in learning about.
An equivalent (and often friendlier) set of manuals is
<a href="http://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/">available from AMD</a>.
Save the Intel/AMD architecture manuals for later
or use them for reference when you want to look up
the definitive explanation
of a particular processor feature or instruction.</p>


<h3 id="Simulating-the-x86">Simulating the x86</h3>

<p>
Instead of developing the operating system on a real, physical personal computer
(PC), we use a program that faithfully emulates a complete PC:
the code you write for the emulator will boot on a real PC too.
Using an emulator simplifies debugging; you can, for example, set
break points inside of the emulated x86, which is difficult
to do with the silicon version of an x86.
</p>

<p>
In 6.828 we will use the
<a href="http://www.qemu.org/">QEMU Emulator</a>,
a modern and relatively fast emulator.
While QEMU's built-in monitor provides only limited debugging support,
QEMU can act as a remote debugging target for the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GNU debugger</a> (GDB), which
we'll use in this lab to step through the early boot process.
</p>

<p>
To get started,
extract the Lab 1 files into your own directory on Athena
as described above in "Software Setup",
then type <kbd>make</kbd> (or <kbd>gmake</kbd> on BSD systems) in
the <tt>lab</tt> directory
to build the minimal 6.828 boot loader and kernel you will start with.
(It's a little generous to call the code we're running here a "kernel,"
but we'll flesh it out throughout the semester.)
</p>

<pre>athena% <kbd>cd lab</kbd>
athena% <kbd>make</kbd>
+ as kern/entry.S
+ cc kern/entrypgdir.c
+ cc kern/init.c
+ cc kern/console.c
+ cc kern/monitor.c
+ cc kern/printf.c
+ cc kern/kdebug.c
+ cc lib/printfmt.c
+ cc lib/readline.c
+ cc lib/string.c
+ ld obj/kern/kernel
+ as boot/boot.S
+ cc -Os boot/main.c
+ ld boot/boot
boot block is 380 bytes (max 510)
+ mk obj/kern/kernel.img
</pre>

<p>
(If you get errors like "undefined reference to `__udivdi3'", you
probably don't have the 32-bit gcc multilib.  If you're running Debian
or Ubuntu, try installing the gcc-multilib package.)
</p>

<p>
Now you're ready to run QEMU, supplying the file <tt>obj/kern/kernel.img</tt>,
created above, as the contents of the emulated PC's "virtual hard disk."
This hard disk image contains both
our boot loader (<tt>obj/boot/boot</tt>)
and our kernel (<tt>obj/kernel</tt>).
</p>

<pre>athena% <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
</pre>

or

<pre>athena% <kbd>make qemu-nox</kbd>
</pre>

<p>This executes QEMU with the options required to set
the hard disk and direct serial port output to the terminal.  Some
text should appear in the QEMU window:</p>

<pre>Booting from Hard Disk...
6828 decimal is XXX octal!
entering test_backtrace 5
entering test_backtrace 4
entering test_backtrace 3
entering test_backtrace 2
entering test_backtrace 1
entering test_backtrace 0
leaving test_backtrace 0
leaving test_backtrace 1
leaving test_backtrace 2
leaving test_backtrace 3
leaving test_backtrace 4
leaving test_backtrace 5
Welcome to the JOS kernel monitor!
Type 'help' for a list of commands.
K&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Everything after '<tt>Booting from Hard Disk...</tt>'
was printed by our skeletal JOS kernel;
the <tt>K&gt;</tt> is the prompt printed by
the small <i>monitor</i>, or interactive control program,
that we've included in the kernel.
If you used <kbd> make qemu</kbd>, these lines printed by the kernel
will appear in both the regular shell window from which you ran QEMU and the
QEMU display window.
This is because for testing and lab grading purposes
we have set up the JOS kernel to write its console output
not only to the virtual VGA display (as seen in the QEMU window),
but also to the simulated PC's virtual serial port,
which QEMU in turn outputs to its own standard output.
Likewise, the JOS kernel will take input from both the keyboard and
the serial port, so you can give it commands in either the VGA display
window or the terminal running QEMU.
Alternatively, you can use the serial console without the virtual VGA
by running <kbd>make qemu-nox</kbd>.  This may be convenient if you
are SSH'd into an Athena dialup. To quit qemu, type <kbd>Ctrl+a x</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
There are only two commands you can give to the kernel monitor,
<tt>help</tt> and <tt>kerninfo</tt>.
<!-- Make sure you type them
(and all other input to JOS) into the VGA display window, not
into the xterm running QEMU. -->
</p>

<pre>K&gt; <kbd>help</kbd>
help - display this list of commands
kerninfo - display information about the kernel
K&gt; <kbd>kerninfo</kbd>
Special kernel symbols:
  entry  f010000c (virt)  0010000c (phys)
  etext  f0101a75 (virt)  00101a75 (phys)
  edata  f0112300 (virt)  00112300 (phys)
  end    f0112960 (virt)  00112960 (phys)
Kernel executable memory footprint: 75KB
K&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>help</tt> command is obvious,
and we will shortly discuss
the meaning of what the <tt>kerninfo</tt> command prints.
Although simple,
it's important to note that this kernel monitor
is running "directly" on the "raw (virtual) hardware"
of the simulated PC.
This means that you should be able to copy
the contents of <tt>obj/kern/kernel.img</tt>
onto the first few sectors of a <i>real</i> hard disk,
insert that hard disk into a real PC,
turn it on,
and see exactly the same thing on the PC's real screen
as you did above in the QEMU window.
(We don't recommend you do this on a real machine
with useful information on its hard disk, though,
because copying <tt>kernel.img</tt> onto the beginning of its hard disk
will trash the master boot record and the beginning of the first partition,
effectively causing everything previously on the hard disk to be lost!)
</p>

<h3 id="The-PC-s-Physical-Address-Space">The PC's Physical Address Space</h3>

<p>
We will now dive into a bit more detail
about how a PC starts up.
A PC's physical address space is hard-wired
to have the following general layout:
</p>

<table align="center"><tbody><tr><td>
<pre>+------------------+  &lt;- 0xFFFFFFFF (4GB)
|      32-bit      |
|  memory mapped   |

|                  |

</pre>

</tbody></table>

<p>
The first PCs,
which were based on the 16-bit Intel 8088 processor,
were only capable of addressing 1MB of physical memory.
The physical address space of an early PC
would therefore start at 0x00000000
but end at 0x000FFFFF instead of 0xFFFFFFFF.
The 640KB area marked "Low Memory"
was the <i>only</i> random-access memory (RAM) that an early PC could use;
in fact the very earliest PCs only could be configured with
16KB, 32KB, or 64KB of RAM!
</p>

<p>
The 384KB area from 0x000A0000 through 0x000FFFFF
was reserved by the hardware for special uses
such as video display buffers
and firmware held in non-volatile memory.
The most important part of this reserved area
is the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS),
which occupies the 64KB region from 0x000F0000 through 0x000FFFFF.
In early PCs the BIOS was held in true read-only memory (ROM),
but current PCs store the BIOS in updateable flash memory.
The BIOS is responsible for performing basic system initialization
such as activating the video card and checking the amount of memory installed.
After performing this initialization,
the BIOS loads the operating system from some appropriate location
such as floppy disk, hard disk, CD-ROM, or the network,
and passes control of the machine to the operating system.
</p>

<p>
When Intel finally "broke the one megabyte barrier"
with the 80286 and 80386 processors,
which supported 16MB and 4GB physical address spaces respectively,
the PC architects nevertheless preserved the original layout
for the low 1MB of physical address space
in order to ensure backward compatibility with existing software.
Modern PCs therefore have a "hole" in physical memory
from 0x000A0000 to 0x00100000,
dividing RAM into "low" or "conventional memory" (the first 640KB)
and "extended memory" (everything else).
In addition,
some space at the very top of the PC's 32-bit physical address space,
above all physical RAM,
is now commonly reserved by the BIOS
for use by 32-bit PCI devices.
</p>

<p>
Recent x86 processors can support
<i>more</i> than 4GB of physical RAM,
so RAM can extend further above 0xFFFFFFFF.
In this case the BIOS must arrange to leave a <i>second</i> hole
in the system's RAM at the top of the 32-bit addressable region,
to leave room for these 32-bit devices to be mapped.
Because of design limitations JOS
will use only the first 256MB
of a PC's physical memory anyway,
so for now we will pretend that all PCs
have "only" a 32-bit physical address space.
But dealing with complicated physical address spaces
and other aspects of hardware organization
that evolved over many years
is one of the important practical challenges of OS development.

<p>In this portion of the lab, you'll use QEMU's debugging facilities to
investigate how an IA-32 compatible computer boots.</p>

<p>Open two terminal windows and <kbd>cd</kbd> both shells into your lab
directory. In one,
enter <kbd>make
qemu-gdb</kbd> (or <kbd>make qemu-nox-gdb</kbd>).  This starts up
QEMU, but QEMU stops just before the
processor executes the first instruction and waits for a debugging
connection from GDB.  In the second terminal, from the same directory
you ran <tt>make</tt>, run <kbd>make gdb</kbd>.  You should see something
like this,</p>

<p>We provided a <tt>.gdbinit</tt> file that set up GDB to debug the 16-bit code
used during early boot and directed it to attach to the listening QEMU.  (If it

this.)

</p><p>The following line:</p>
<pre>[f000:fff0] 0xffff0:	ljmp   $0xf000,$0xe05b
</pre>

<p>is GDB's disassembly of the first instruction to be executed.
From this output you can conclude a few things: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>	The IBM PC starts executing at physical address 0x000ffff0,
	which is at the very top of the 64KB area reserved for the ROM BIOS.</li>

<li>	The PC starts executing
	with <tt>CS = 0xf000</tt> and <tt>IP = 0xfff0</tt>.</li>

<li>	The first instruction to be executed is a <tt>jmp</tt> instruction,
	which jumps to the segmented address
	<tt>CS = 0xf000</tt> and <tt>IP = 0xe05b</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why does QEMU start like this?
This is how Intel designed the 8088 processor,
which IBM used in their original PC.
Because the BIOS in a PC is "hard-wired"
to the physical address range 0x000f0000-0x000fffff,
this design ensures that the BIOS always gets control of the machine first
after power-up or any system restart -
which is crucial because on power-up
there <i>is</i> no other software anywhere in the machine's RAM
that the processor could execute.
The QEMU emulator comes with its own BIOS,
which it places at this location
in the processor's simulated physical address space.
On processor reset,
the (simulated) processor enters real mode
and sets CS to 0xf000 and the IP to 0xfff0, so that
execution begins at that (CS:IP) segment address.
How does the segmented address 0xf000:fff0
turn into a physical address?
</p>

<p>To answer that we need to know a bit about real mode addressing.
In real mode (the mode that PC starts off in),
address translation works according to the formula:
<i>physical address</i> = 16 * <i>segment</i> + <i>offset</i>.
So, when the PC sets CS to 0xf000 and IP to
0xfff0, the physical address referenced is:</p>

<pre>   16 * 0xf000 + 0xfff0   # in hex multiplication by 16 is
   = 0xf0000 + 0xfff0     # easy--just append a 0.
   = 0xffff0 
</pre>

<p>
<tt>0xffff0</tt> is 16 bytes before the end of the BIOS (<tt>0x100000</tt>).
Therefore we shouldn't be surprised that the
first thing that the BIOS does is <tt>jmp</tt> backwards
to an earlier location in the BIOS; after all
how much could it accomplish in just 16 bytes?

	Use GDB's <kbd>si</kbd> (Step Instruction) command
	to trace into the ROM BIOS
	for a few more instructions,
	and try to guess what it might be doing.
	You might want to look at
	<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040404164813/members.iweb.net.au/~pstorr/pcbook/book2/book2.htm">Phil Storrs I/O Ports Description</a>,
	as well as other materials on the
	<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html">6.828 reference materials page</a>.
	No need to figure out all the details -
	just the general idea of what the BIOS is doing first.</p>
</div>

<p>
When the BIOS runs,
it sets up an interrupt descriptor table
and initializes various devices such as the VGA display.
This is where the "<tt>Starting SeaBIOS</tt>" message
you see in the QEMU window comes from.
</p>

<p>
After initializing the PCI bus
and all the important devices the BIOS knows about,
it searches for a bootable device
such as a floppy, hard drive, or CD-ROM.
Eventually, when it finds a bootable disk,
the BIOS reads the <i>boot loader</i> from the disk
and transfers control to it.
</p>

<h2 id="Part-2--The-Boot-Loader">Part 2: The Boot Loader</h2>

<p>Floppy and hard disks for PCs are
divided into 512 byte regions called <i>sectors</i>.
A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity:
each read or write operation must be one or more sectors in size
and aligned on a sector boundary.
If the disk is bootable,
the first sector is called the <i>boot sector</i>,
since this is where the boot loader code resides.
When the BIOS finds a bootable floppy or hard disk,
it loads the 512-byte boot sector
into memory at physical addresses 0x7c00 through 0x7dff,
and then uses a <tt>jmp</tt> instruction
to set the CS:IP to <tt>0000:7c00</tt>,
passing control to the boot loader.
Like the BIOS load address,
these addresses are fairly arbitrary -
but they are fixed and standardized for PCs.
</p>

<p>
The ability to boot from a CD-ROM came much later
during the evolution of the PC,
and as a result the PC architects took the opportunity
to rethink the boot process slightly.
As a result,
the way a modern BIOS boots from a CD-ROM
is a bit more complicated (and more powerful).
CD-ROMs use a sector size of 2048 bytes instead of 512,
and the BIOS can load a much larger boot image from the disk into memory
(not just one sector)
before transferring control to it.
For more information,
see the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/boot-cdrom.pdf">"El Torito" Bootable CD-ROM Format Specification</a>.
</p>

<p>
For 6.828, however,
we will use the conventional hard drive boot mechanism,
which means that our boot loader must fit into a measly 512 bytes.
The boot loader consists of
one assembly language source file, <tt>boot/boot.S</tt>,
and one C source file, <tt>boot/main.c</tt>
Look through these source files carefully
and make sure you understand what's going on.
The boot loader must perform two main functions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>	First, the boot loader switches the processor from real mode to
	<i>32-bit protected mode</i>,
	because it is only in this mode
	that software can access all the memory above 1MB
	in the processor's physical address space.
	Protected mode is described briefly
	in sections 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 of
	<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf">PC Assembly Language</a>,
	and in great detail in the Intel architecture manuals.
	At this point you only have to understand
	that translation of segmented addresses (segment:offset pairs)
	into physical addresses happens differently in protected mode,
	and that after the transition
	offsets are 32 bits instead of 16.</li>

<li>	Second, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk
	by directly accessing the IDE disk device registers
	via the x86's special I/O instructions.
	If you would like to understand better
	what the particular I/O instructions here mean,
	check out the "IDE hard drive controller" section
	on <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html">the 6.828 reference page</a>.
	You will not need to learn much
	about programming specific devices in this class:
	writing device drivers is in practice
	a very important part of OS development,
	but from a conceptual or architectural viewpoint
	it is also one of the least interesting.</li>
</ol>

<p>
After you understand the boot loader source code,
look at the file <tt>obj/boot/boot.asm</tt>.
This file is a disassembly of the boot loader
that our GNUmakefile creates <i>after</i> compiling the boot loader.
This disassembly file makes it easy to see
exactly where in physical memory all of the boot loader's code resides,
and makes it easier to track what's happening
while stepping through the boot loader in GDB.
Likewise, <tt>obj/kern/kernel.asm</tt> contains a disassembly of the
JOS kernel, which can often be useful for debugging.
</p>

<p>
You can set address breakpoints in GDB with the <tt>b</tt>
command.  For example, <kbd>b *0x7c00</kbd> sets a
breakpoint at address 0x7C00.  Once at a breakpoint, you can continue
execution using the <kbd>c</kbd> and
<kbd>si</kbd> commands: <kbd>c</kbd> causes
QEMU to continue execution until the next breakpoint (or until you press
<kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> in GDB), and <kbd>si
<i>N</i></kbd> steps through the instructions <i><tt>N</tt></i> at a time.
</p>

<p>
To examine instructions in memory (besides the immediate next one to be
executed, which GDB prints automatically), you use the
<kbd>x/i</kbd> command.  This command has the syntax
<kbd>x/<i>N</i>i <i>ADDR</i></kbd>, where <i>N</i> is the
number of consecutive instructions to disassemble and <i>ADDR</i> is the
memory address at which to start disassembling.

	commands that are useful for OS work.</p>

	<p>
	Set a breakpoint at address 0x7c00, which is
	where the boot sector will be loaded.
	Continue execution until that breakpoint.
	Trace through the code in <tt>boot/boot.S</tt>,

	sequences of instructions in the boot loader,
	and compare the original boot loader source code
	with both the disassembly in <tt>obj/boot/boot.asm</tt>
	and GDB.

	and identify the begin and end of the <tt>for</tt> loop
	that reads the remaining sectors of the kernel from the disk.
	Find out what code will run when the loop is finished,
	set a breakpoint there, and continue to that breakpoint.
	Then step through the remainder of the boot loader.
</p></div>

<p>
Be able to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>	At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code?
	What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?</li>
<li>	What is the <i>last</i> instruction of the boot loader executed,
	and what is the <i>first</i> instruction of the kernel it just loaded?</li>
<li>	<i>Where</i> is the first instruction of the kernel?</li>

We will now look in further detail

this is a good time to stop and review
some of the basics of C programming.

</div>

<p>
To make sense out of <tt>boot/main.c</tt>
you'll need to know what an ELF binary is.
When you compile and link a C program such as the JOS kernel,
the compiler transforms each C source ('<tt>.c</tt>') file
into an <i>object</i> ('<tt>.o</tt>') file
containing assembly language instructions
encoded in the binary format expected by the hardware.
The linker then combines all of the compiled object files
into a single <i>binary image</i> such as <tt>obj/kern/kernel</tt>,
which in this case is a binary in the ELF format,
which stands for "Executable and Linkable Format".
</p>

<p>
Full information about this format is available in
<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/elf.pdf">the ELF specification</a>
on <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/reference.html">our reference page</a>,
but you will not need to delve very deeply
into the details of this format in this class.
Although as a whole the format is quite powerful and complex,
most of the complex parts are for supporting
dynamic loading of shared libraries,
which we will not do in this class.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">Wikipedia
page</a> has a short description.
</p>

<p>
For purposes of 6.828,
you can consider an ELF executable to be
a header with loading information,
followed by several <i>program sections</i>,
each of which is a contiguous chunk of code or data
intended to be loaded into memory at a specified address.
The boot loader does not modify the code or data; it
loads it into memory and starts executing it.
</p>

<p>
An ELF binary starts with a fixed-length <i>ELF header</i>,
followed by a variable-length <i>program header</i>
listing each of the program sections to be loaded.
The C definitions for these ELF headers are in <tt>inc/elf.h</tt>.
The program sections we're interested in are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>	<tt>.text</tt>:
	The program's executable instructions.</li>
<li>	<tt>.rodata</tt>:
	Read-only data,
	such as ASCII string constants produced by the C compiler.
	(We will not bother setting up the hardware to prohibit writing,
	however.)</li>
<li>	<tt>.data</tt>:
	The data section holds the program's initialized data,
	such as global variables declared with initializers
	like <tt>int x = 5;</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the linker computes the memory layout of a program,
it reserves space for <i>uninitialized</i> global variables,
such as <tt>int x;</tt>,
in a section called <tt>.bss</tt>
that immediately follows <tt>.data</tt> in memory.
C requires that "uninitialized" global variables start with
a value of zero.
Thus there is no need to store contents for <tt>.bss</tt>
in the ELF binary; instead, the linker records just the address and
size of the <tt>.bss</tt> section.
The loader or the program itself must arrange to zero the
<tt>.bss</tt> section.
</p>

<p>
Examine the full list of the names, sizes, and link addresses
of all the sections in the kernel executable by typing:
</p>

<pre>athena% <kbd>objdump -h obj/kern/kernel</kbd>
</pre>

<pre>(If you compiled your own toolchain, you may need to use <kbd>i386-jos-elf-objdump</kbd>)
</pre>

<p>
You will see many more sections than the ones we listed above,
but the others are not important for our purposes.
Most of the others are to hold debugging information,
which is typically included in the program's executable file
but not loaded into memory by the program loader.
</p>

<p>
Take particular note of the "VMA" (or <i>link address</i>) and the
"LMA" (or <i>load address</i>) of the
<tt>.text</tt> section.
The load address of a section is the memory address at which that
section should be loaded into memory.
</p>

<p>
The link address of a section is the memory address from which the
section expects to execute.  The linker encodes the link address in
the binary in various ways, such as when the code needs the address of
a global variable, with the result that a binary usually won't work if
it is executing from an address that it is not linked for.  (It is
possible to generate <i>position-independent</i> code that does not
contain any such absolute addresses.  This is used extensively by
modern shared libraries, but it has performance and complexity costs,
so we won't be using it in 6.828.)
</p>

<p>
Typically, the link and load addresses are the same.  For example,
look at the <tt>.text</tt> section of the boot loader:
</p>
<pre>athena% <kbd>objdump -h obj/boot/boot.out</kbd>
</pre>
<p>
The boot loader uses the ELF <i>program headers</i> to decide how to load the
sections. The program headers specify which parts of the ELF object to load
into memory and the destination address each should occupy. You can inspect the
program headers by typing:
</p>

<pre>athena% <kbd>objdump -x obj/kern/kernel</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
The program headers are then listed under "Program Headers" in the output of
objdump. The areas of the ELF object that need to be loaded into memory are
those that are marked as "LOAD". Other information for each program header is
given, such as the virtual address ("vaddr"), the physical address ("paddr"),
and the size of the loaded area ("memsz" and "filesz").
</p>

<p>
Back in boot/main.c, the <code>ph-&gt;p_pa</code> field of each program header
contains the segment's destination physical address (in this case, it really is
a physical address, though the ELF specification is vague on the actual meaning
of this field).
</p>

<p>
The BIOS loads the boot sector into memory starting at address 0x7c00,
so this is the boot sector's load address.  This is also where the
boot sector executes from, so this is also its link address.  We set
the link address by passing <tt>-Ttext 0x7C00</tt> to the linker in
<tt>boot/Makefrag</tt>, so the linker will produce the correct memory
addresses in the generated code.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-5" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 5.</span>
	Trace through the first few instructions of the boot loader again
	and identify the first instruction that would "break"
	or otherwise do the wrong thing
	if you were to get the boot loader's link address wrong.
	Then change the link address in <tt>boot/Makefrag</tt>
	to something wrong,
	run <kbd>make clean</kbd>,
	recompile the lab with <kbd>make</kbd>,
	and trace into the boot loader again to see what happens.
	Don't forget to change the link address back and <kbd>make
	clean</kbd> again afterward!
</p></div>

<p>
Look back at the load and link addresses for the kernel.  Unlike the
boot loader, these two addresses aren't the same: the kernel is
telling the boot loader to load it into memory at a low address (1
megabyte), but it expects to execute from a high address.  We'll dig
in to how we make this work in the next section.
</p>

<p>
Besides the section information,
there is one more field in the ELF header that is important to us,
named <tt>e_entry</tt>.
This field holds the link address
of the <i>entry point</i> in the program:
the memory address in the program's text section
at which the program should begin executing.
You can see the entry point:
</p>

<pre>athena% <kbd>objdump -f obj/kern/kernel</kbd>
</pre>

<p>
You should now be able to understand the minimal ELF loader in
<tt>boot/main.c</tt>.  It reads each section of the kernel from disk
into memory at the section's load address and then jumps to the
kernel's entry point.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-6" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>

	We can examine memory using GDB's <kbd>x</kbd> command.  The
	<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Memory.html">GDB

	that the command <kbd>x/<i>N</i>x <i>ADDR</i></kbd> prints
	<i><tt>N</tt></i> words of memory at <i><tt>ADDR</tt></i>.
	(Note that both '<tt>x</tt>'s in the command are lowercase.)

<h2 id="Part-3--The-Kernel">Part 3: The Kernel</h2>

<p>
We will now start to examine the minimal JOS kernel in a bit more detail.
(And you will finally get to write some code!).
Like the boot loader,
the kernel begins with some assembly language code
that sets things up so that C language code can execute properly.
</p>

<h3 id="Using-virtual-memory-to-work-around-position-dependence">Using virtual memory to work around position dependence</h3>

<p>
When you inspected the boot loader's link and load addresses above,
they matched perfectly, but there was a (rather large) disparity 
between the <i>kernel's</i> link address (as printed by objdump) and
its load address.
Go back and check both and make sure you can see what we're talking about.
(Linking the kernel is more complicated than the boot loader, so the
link and load addresses are at the top of <tt>kern/kernel.ld</tt>.)
</p>

<p>
Operating system kernels often like to be linked and run
at very high <i>virtual address</i>, such as 0xf0100000,
in order to leave the lower part of the processor's virtual address space
for user programs to use.
The reason for this arrangement will become clearer in the next lab.
</p>

<p>
Many machines don't have any physical memory at address 0xf0100000,
so we can't count on being able to store the kernel there.
Instead, we will use the processor's memory management hardware
to map virtual address 0xf0100000
(the link address at which the kernel code <i>expects</i> to run)
to physical address 0x00100000
(where the boot loader loaded the kernel into physical memory).
This way, although the kernel's virtual address is high enough
to leave plenty of address space for user processes,
it will be loaded in physical memory at the 1MB point in the PC's RAM,
just above the BIOS ROM.
This approach requires that the PC have at least a few megabytes of
physical memory (so that physical address 0x00100000 works), but this is likely
to be true of any PC built after about 1990.
</p>

<p>
In fact, in the next lab, we will map the <i>entire</i> bottom 256MB
of the PC's physical address space,
from physical addresses 0x00000000 through 0x0fffffff,
to virtual addresses 0xf0000000 through 0xffffffff respectively.
You should now see why JOS can only use
the first 256MB of physical memory.
</p>

<p>
For now, we'll just map the first 4MB of physical memory, which will
be enough to get us up and running.  We do this using the
hand-written, statically-initialized page directory and page table in
<tt>kern/entrypgdir.c</tt>.  For now, you don't have to understand the
details of how this works, just the effect that it accomplishes.  Up
until <tt>kern/entry.S</tt> sets the <code>CR0_PG</code> flag, memory
references are treated as physical addresses (strictly speaking,
they're linear addresses, but boot/boot.S set up an identity mapping
from linear addresses to physical addresses and we're never going to
change that).  Once <code>CR0_PG</code> is set, memory references are
virtual addresses that get translated by the virtual memory hardware
to physical addresses.  <code>entry_pgdir</code> translates virtual
addresses in the range 0xf0000000 through 0xf0400000 to physical
addresses 0x00000000 through 0x00400000, as well as virtual addresses
0x00000000 through 0x00400000 to physical addresses 0x00000000 through
0x00400000.  Any virtual address that is not in one of these two
ranges will cause a hardware exception which, since we haven't set up
interrupt handling yet, will cause QEMU to dump the machine state and
exit (or endlessly reboot if you aren't using the 6.828-patched
version of QEMU).

</ul></li>
<li> Run the following code.

What is the output?  Explain how this output is arrived at in the
step-by-step manner of the previous exercise.
<a href="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~michael/c/ascii-table.html">Here's an ASCII

<p>The output depends on that fact that the x86 is little-endian.  If

<h3 id="The-Stack">The Stack</h3>

<p>
In the final exercise of this lab,
we will explore in more detail
the way the C language uses the stack on the x86,
and in the process write a useful new kernel monitor function
that prints a <i>backtrace</i> of the stack:
a list of the saved Instruction Pointer (IP) values
from the nested <tt>call</tt> instructions that
led to the current point of execution.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-9" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 9.</span>
	Determine where the kernel initializes its stack,
	and exactly where in memory its stack is located.
	How does the kernel reserve space for its stack?
	And at which "end" of this reserved area
	is the stack pointer initialized to point to?
</p></div>

<p>
The x86 stack pointer (<tt>esp</tt> register)
points to the lowest location on the stack that is
currently in use.
Everything <i>below</i> that location in the region reserved for the stack
is free.
Pushing a value onto the stack involves decreasing the stack
pointer and then writing the value to the place the stack pointer
points to.
Popping a value from the stack involves reading the value
the stack pointer points to and then increasing the stack pointer.
In 32-bit mode, the stack can only hold 32-bit values,
and esp is always divisible by four.
Various x86 instructions, such as <tt>call</tt>,
are "hard-wired" to use the stack pointer register.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>ebp</tt> (base pointer) register, in contrast,
is associated with the stack primarily by software convention.
On entry to a C function,
the function's <i>prologue</i> code normally
saves the previous function's base pointer by pushing it onto the stack,
and then copies the current <tt>esp</tt> value into <tt>ebp</tt>
for the duration of the function.
If all the functions in a program obey this convention,
then at any given point during the program's execution,
it is possible to trace back through the stack
by following the chain of saved <tt>ebp</tt> pointers
and determining exactly what nested sequence of function calls
caused this particular point in the program to be reached.
This capability can be particularly useful, for example,
when a particular function causes an <tt>assert</tt> failure or <tt>panic</tt>
because bad arguments were passed to it,
but you aren't sure <i>who</i> passed the bad arguments.
A stack backtrace lets you find the offending function.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-10" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 10.</span>
	To become familiar with the C calling conventions on the x86,
	find the address of the <code>test_backtrace</code> function
	in <tt>obj/kern/kernel.asm</tt>,
	set a breakpoint there,
	and examine what happens each time it gets called
	after the kernel starts.
	How many 32-bit words does each recursive nesting level
	of <code>test_backtrace</code> push on the stack,
	and what are those words?</p>

	<p>Note that, for this exercise to work properly, you should
	be using the patched version of QEMU available on the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/tools.html">tools</a> page or on Athena.
	Otherwise, you'll have to manually translate all breakpoint
	and memory addresses to linear addresses.
</p></div>

<p>
The above exercise should give you the information you need
to implement a stack backtrace function,
which you should call <code>mon_backtrace()</code>.
A prototype for this function is already waiting for you
in <tt>kern/monitor.c</tt>.
You can do it entirely in C,
but you may find the <code>read_ebp()</code> function in <tt>inc/x86.h</tt> useful.
You'll also have to hook this new function
into the kernel monitor's command list
so that it can be invoked interactively by the user.
</p>

<p>
The backtrace function should display a listing of function call frames
in the following format:
</p>

<pre>Stack backtrace:
  ebp f0109e58  eip f0100a62  args 00000001 f0109e80 f0109e98 f0100ed2 00000031
  ebp f0109ed8  eip f01000d6  args 00000000 00000000 f0100058 f0109f28 00000061
  ...
</pre>

<p>
Each line contains an <tt>ebp</tt>, <tt>eip</tt>, and <tt>args</tt>.
The <tt>ebp</tt> value indicates the base pointer into the stack
used by that function:
i.e., the position of the stack pointer just after the function was entered
and the function prologue code set up the base pointer.
The listed <tt>eip</tt> value
is the function's <i>return instruction pointer</i>:
the instruction address to which
control will return when the function returns.
The return instruction pointer typically points to the instruction
after the <tt>call</tt> instruction (why?).
Finally, the five hex values listed after <tt>args</tt>
are the first five arguments to the function in question,
which would have been pushed on the stack just before the function was called.
If the function was called with fewer than five arguments, of course,
then not all five of these values will be useful.
(Why can't the backtrace code detect how many arguments there actually are?
How could this limitation be fixed?)
</p>

<p>
The first line printed reflects the <i>currently executing</i> function,
namely <code>mon_backtrace</code> itself,
the second line reflects the function that called <code>mon_backtrace</code>,
the third line reflects the function that called that one, and so on.
You should print <i>all</i> the outstanding stack frames.
By studying <tt>kern/entry.S</tt>
you'll find that there is an easy way to tell when to stop.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few specific points you read about in K&amp;R Chapter 5 that are
worth remembering for the following exercise and for future labs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>int *p = (int*)100</code>, then 
    <code>(int)p + 1</code> and <code>(int)(p + 1)</code>
    are different numbers: the first is <code>101</code> but
    the second is <code>104</code>.
    When adding an integer to a pointer, as in the second case,
    the integer is implicitly multiplied by the size of the object
    the pointer points to.</li>
<li><code>p[i]</code> is defined to be the same as <code>*(p+i)</code>,
referring to the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.
The above rule for addition helps this definition work
when the objects are larger than one byte.</li>
<li> <code>&amp;p[i]</code> is the same as <code>(p+i)</code>, yielding
the address of the i'th object in the memory pointed to by p.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although most C programs never need to cast between pointers and integers,
operating systems frequently do.
Whenever you see an addition involving a memory address,
ask yourself whether it is an integer addition or pointer addition
and make sure the value being added is appropriately multiplied
or not.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-11" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 11.</span>
	Implement the backtrace function as specified above.
	Use the same format as in the example, since otherwise the
	grading script will be confused.
	When you think you have it working right,
	run <kbd>make grade</kbd> to see if its output
	conforms to what our grading script expects,
	and fix it if it doesn't.
	<i>After</i> you have handed in your Lab 1 code,
	you are welcome to change the output format of the backtrace function
	any way you like.</p>

	<p>If you use <code>read_ebp()</code>, note that GCC may generate
	"optimized" code that calls <code>read_ebp()</code> <i>before</i>
	<code>mon_backtrace()</code>'s function prologue, which results in an
	incomplete stack trace (the stack frame of the most recent function
	call is missing). While we have tried to disable optimizations that
	cause this reordering, you may want to examine the assembly of
	<code>mon_backtrace()</code> and make sure the call to
	<code>read_ebp()</code> is happening after the function prologue.
</p></div>

<p>
At this point, your backtrace function should give you the addresses of
the function callers on the stack that lead to <code>mon_backtrace()</code>
being executed.  However, in practice you often want to know the function
names corresponding to those addresses.  For instance, you may want to know
which functions could contain a bug that's causing your kernel to crash.
</p>

<p>
To help you implement this functionality, we have provided the function
<code>debuginfo_eip()</code>, which looks up <tt>eip</tt> in the symbol table
and returns the debugging information for that address.  This function is
defined in <tt>kern/kdebug.c</tt>.
</p>

<div class="required"><div id="Exercise-12" style="position: relative; top: -5em;"></div>
<p><span class="header">Exercise 12.</span>
        Modify your stack backtrace function to display, for each <tt>eip</tt>,
        the function name, source file name, and line number corresponding
        to that <tt>eip</tt>.</p>

        <p>In <code>debuginfo_eip</code>, where do <tt>__STAB_*</tt> come
        from? This question has a long answer; to help you to
        discover the answer, here are some things you might want to
        do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> look in the file <tt>kern/kernel.ld</tt> for <tt>__STAB_*</tt></li>
          <li> run <kbd>objdump -h obj/kern/kernel</kbd></li>
          <li> run <kbd>objdump -G obj/kern/kernel</kbd></li>
          <li> run <kbd>gcc -pipe -nostdinc -O2
          -fno-builtin -I. -MD -Wall -Wno-format -DJOS_KERNEL -gstabs
          -c -S kern/init.c</kbd>, and look at init.s.</li>
          <li> see if the bootloader loads the symbol table in memory as part of
          loading the kernel binary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Complete the implementation of <code>debuginfo_eip</code> by
        inserting the call to <code>stab_binsearch</code> to find the line
        number for an address.</p>
	<p>Add a <tt>backtrace</tt> command to the kernel monitor, and
	extend your implementation of <code>mon_backtrace</code> to
	call <code>debuginfo_eip</code> and print a line for each
	stack frame of the form:</p>
	<pre>K&gt; backtrace
Stack backtrace:
  ebp f010ff78  eip f01008ae  args 00000001 f010ff8c 00000000 f0110580 00000000
         kern/monitor.c:143: monitor+106
  ebp f010ffd8  eip f0100193  args 00000000 00001aac 00000660 00000000 00000000
         kern/init.c:49: i386_init+59
  ebp f010fff8  eip f010003d  args 00000000 00000000 0000ffff 10cf9a00 0000ffff
         kern/entry.S:70: &lt;unknown&gt;+0
K&gt; 
</pre>
	<p>Each line gives the file name and line within that file of
	the stack frame's <tt>eip</tt>, followed by the name of the
	function and the offset of the <tt>eip</tt> from the first
	instruction of the function (e.g., <tt>monitor+106</tt> means
	the return <tt>eip</tt> is 106 bytes past the beginning of
	<tt>monitor</tt>).</p>
	<p>Be sure to print the file and function names on a separate
	line, to avoid confusing the grading script.</p>
	<p>Tip: printf format strings provide an easy, albeit obscure,
	way to print non-null-terminated strings like those in STABS
	tables.	 <code>printf("%.*s", length, string)</code> prints at
	most <code>length</code> characters of <code>string</code>.
	Take a look at the printf man page to find out why this
	works.</p>
	<p>
        You may find that some functions are missing from the
        backtrace. For example, you will probably see a call to
        <code>monitor()</code> but not to <code>runcmd()</code>. This is
        because the compiler in-lines some function calls.
        Other optimizations may cause you to see unexpected line
        numbers. If you get rid of the <tt>-O2</tt> from
        <tt>GNUMakefile</tt>, the backtraces may make more sense
        (but your kernel will run more slowly).
